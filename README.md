# Snake
Hi, I coded this game in July, 2019 using HTML/CSS and javascript. This game is a variant of the traditional snake game, but is unique in that it gives the user the option to add their own obstacles, which are denoted as rocks. You can locally save rock configurations to your web browser.

Have fun,
Alan
